Practical Machine Learning - Prediction Assignment Writeup
Shouvik Sharma
October 29, 2017

1. Summary
This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from the Practical Machine Learning course, which is a part of the Data Science Specialization. It was written and coded in RStudio, using its knitr functions and published in the html format. The purpose of this analysis is to predict the manner in which the six participants performed the exercises described below and to answer the questions of the associated course quiz. The machine learning algorithm, which uses the classe variable in the training set, is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data. The predictions are submitted to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for grading.

2. Introduction
Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit can enable collecting a large amount of data about someoneâ€™s physical activity. These devices are used by the enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. However, even though these enthusiasts regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways.

4. Data Loading and Cleaning
Set working directory.

setwd("C:/Users/HP/Documents/coursera/ml")
Load the required R packages and set a seed.

library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
set.seed(1813)
Load the training and test datasets.

url_train <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
url_quiz  <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
data_train <- read.csv(url(url_train), strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))
data_quiz  <- read.csv(url(url_quiz),  strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA",""))
dim(data_train)
## [1] 19622   160
dim(data_quiz)
## [1]  20 160
Create two partitions (75 % and 25 %) within the original training dataset.

in_train  <- createDataPartition(data_train$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
train_set <- data_train[ in_train, ]
test_set  <- data_train[-in_train, ]
dim(train_set)
## [1] 14718   160
dim(test_set)
## [1] 4904  160
The two datasets (train_set and test_set) have a large number of NA values as well as near-zero-variance (NZV) variables. Both will be removed together with their ID variables.

nzv_var <- nearZeroVar(train_set)
train_set <- train_set[ , -nzv_var]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -nzv_var]
dim(train_set)
## [1] 14718   121
dim(test_set)
## [1] 4904  121
Remove variables that are mostly NA. A threshlod of 95 % is selected.

na_var <- sapply(train_set, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
train_set <- train_set[ , na_var == FALSE]
test_set  <- test_set [ , na_var == FALSE]
dim(train_set)
## [1] 14718    59
dim(test_set)
## [1] 4904   59
Since columns 1 to 5 are identification variables only, they will be removed as well.

train_set <- train_set[ , -(1:5)]
test_set  <- test_set [ , -(1:5)]
dim(train_set)
## [1] 14718    54
dim(test_set)
## [1] 4904   54
The number of variables for the analysis has been reduced from the original 160 down to 54.
